### I was born in Bogota Colombia ⛰️
### At age 4 going on 5 my family moved to united states ✈️🗽 
### From the age of 8 I began helping my mom cleaning homes 🏠.
### as I cleaned these big houses with my mom I would day dream of owning a big home too one day.
### Since then I have worked in almost anything imaginable 🧑‍🔧 🧑‍🏭 👷  
### sometimes being exploided for working illegaly despite being underage 👶 
### Since my family was "poor" I had to make sure I worked if I wanted to have nice things as a kid. 
### My mother thaught me that anything you do you must do it as best as you can and humbly let your results to speak for themselves.

### At 24 years old i made a drastic decision that changed thye course of my life 🛫
### I Chose to relocate back to Colombia and learn software programming. 🧑‍💼 💻
### It is with great glee that I now work happily in what I do 😊, not because of a mere salary but because I'm developing skills ✨ that make me a valuable to any company.
### the satisfaction of understanding how to do cool things through logic and patience, has convinced me to dedicate my life to mastering these skills. 🕹️
