My Name is James Chaves I was born in Bogota Colombia. At age 4 going on 5 my family moved to united states. From the age of 8 i started working with my mom, cleaning homes. Since then I have worked in almost anything imaginable, sometimes being exploided for being too young to work and therefore working illegaly. Since my family was "poor" I had to make sure I worked if I wanted to have nice things as a kid. My mother thought me that anything you do you must do it as best as you can and humbly let your results to speak for themselves.

 Ater 19 years of living in the U.S I have returned to Colombia. My birth place is a foreign country to me now and  i feel like turist! lol. My spanish is not very good but I am determined to work for pleasure from now on. I love software programming. the joy it gives me to know i am working very hard not for a salary but for a skill that will make me useful and very happy with myself. the satisfaction of understanding how to do cool things and through logic and patience, has convinced me to dedicate my life to mastering these skills.

I have a long way to go and it wont be easy but I sure as hell am very happy to bust my head learning for my future and not breaking my back for a paycheck.
